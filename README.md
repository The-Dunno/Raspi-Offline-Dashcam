# Raspi-Offline-Dashcam
## About

This is a project I created to turn a Raspberry Pi Zero 1.3 into a **offline dashcam** that saves **short videos to the SD card**. I will use **bash scripts** that execute when the pi turns on, so that it **can just be left on your dash and forgotten about** until you need the footage. It is a **work in progress**.
